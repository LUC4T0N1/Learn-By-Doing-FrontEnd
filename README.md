# About the project
https://learn-by-doing.netlify.app/

An educational system focused on user learning. It provides an environment where any user can create and resolve tests on any subject. Right after the completion, it is possible to see the answers and even the correction of the test performed. The system has a wide search engine, which facilitates the search for testes and subjects, in addition to allowing the use of questions created by other users in your own tests.
This is the repository for the Front End code. to check the Back End code click here -> https://github.com/LUC4T0N1/Learn-By-Doing-BackEnd
